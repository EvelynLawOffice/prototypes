# EvelynLaw Prototypes

This repository serves as a sandbox for design and layout explorations for the upcoming Evelyn Law website redesign.

## Folder Index

- **tailwindcss4/** — Current working prototype using Vite + Tailwind CSS. Intended for exploring layout and styling directions for the homepage and beyond.
- **clientbackup/** — Archived files from the current live site. Used for reference and asset pulls only.
- *(More folders may be added as new prototypes are created.)*

## Notes

This space is intentionally flexible. It exists to:
- Experiment with layout, typography, structure, and tone
- Try new visual ideas without risk
- Act as a personal dev lab before formal integration into the live repo
